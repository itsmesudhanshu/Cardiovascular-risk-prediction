#**Problem Statement**
Hello learners in this project my friend kapil and I Sudhanshu chouhan have done a combined analysis on corona virus tweets.We have analysed In this project the mantle state of people during the covid and their mentality toward the pandemic. This pandemic has changed our lifestyle completely and we have to adapt to a newer version of the world.




#**Data Cleaning**
In this project we have given a data which is classified on the basis of positive ,negative,neutral, extremely positive and extremely negative sentiment. So , we have to to divide this data after that we have to modify the data by removing less important things from the data like hashtags , urls etc.


#**Model deployement**
We have done model deployement and analyses the data on multiple and binary basis



#**Conclusion**

We first evaluated the the model on the basis of multipleclassification where we have taken multiple sentiments into consideration which includes positive ,negative,neutral, extremely positive and extremely negative sentiment.

After applying various classification algorithm we come to a conclusion that the best is logistic classification is best with a score of 61 percent for multi classification.

After multiple classification we divided our data into binary classification, in which extremely positive, positive and netral are taken as 1 and extremely negative and negative are taken as 0 for classification.

The output after Deploying various Model into the system remains the same and the best algorithm comes out to be Stochastic Gradient Descent.
